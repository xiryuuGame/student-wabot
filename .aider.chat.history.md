You want to rename the current branch from 'master' to 'main'. Since this is a git operation, I will provide the command to do so.

```bash
git branch -m master main
```

I cannot directly push the project to the remote repository. I can only provide the commands to do so.

First, you need to add the remote repository:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/xiryuuGame/student-wabot.git
```

Then, you can push the project to the remote repository:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

You might be prompted for your GitHub username and password. If you have 2FA enabled, you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your password.

#### failed  

The error message "src refspec main does not match any" indicates that there is no branch named `main` in your local repository. This is likely because the `git init` command created an empty repository without any commits. You need to add and commit your files before pushing.

Here's what you need to do:

1.  Add the files to the staging area:

```bash
git add .
```

2.  Commit the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

3.  Then try pushing again:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```
